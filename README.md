# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Mouse Control

## 🤖 Project Genesis
This project was **developed using AI technologies**, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted software development. By leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning models, we've created an innovative human-computer interaction solution.

## 🌟 Project Overview
A mouse control system that transforms hand gestures into seamless computer interactions, eliminating the need for physical mouse input.

## 🚀 Core Concept
Utilizing real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, the application allows users to:
- Control cursor movement
- Perform clicks
- Scroll pages
- Interact with computer interfaces using hand gestures

## 🔬 Technical Approach
### Technological Architecture
- **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Mouse Interaction**: PyWin32
- **Programming Language**: Python

### Gesture Recognition Mechanics
- **Index Finger**: 
  - Cursor movement
  - Left-click simulation
- **Middle Finger**: 
  - Right-click simulation
- **All Fingers Extended**: 
  - Page scrolling functionality

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam

## 📦 Installation

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pywin32
```

## 🎮 Usage
```bash
python hand_gesture_control.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Webcam captures hand movements in real-time
2. MediaPipe processes hand landmarks
3. Custom algorithms translate hand gestures to mouse actions
4. PyWin32 simulates mouse interactions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Maintain clear hand visibility
- Close conflicting camera applications
